# GOKP Documentation
This is the documentation page for [gokp](https://github.com/christianh814/gokp)

GOKP aims to be a GitOps native Kubernetes Platform. You can read more at the above link. This repo is intended to be the source of documentation for the PoC. The documentation (like the PoC) is "best effort" and is also in a "Proof of Concept" state. Please feel free to submit a PR if you find something is missing.
